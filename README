KERNING INPUT FILE COMPILER

This is a pretty raw compiler for the Kerning Input File, a text file to
kern fonts in TrueType AAT. Its output is a hex code for the state
machine kerning table that you fuse into a font with OS X Font Tools.


REQUIREMENTS & USAGE

You'll need a dump of your font's 'post' table first. It will be used to
lookup the glyph names, so the table has to be in a format that actually
lists those. Produce the dump with OS X Font Tools by running:

ftxdumperfuser --table post --output post.xml font.ttf

Having both the 'post' dump and your kerning file in place, simply run:

kif.sh post.xml kern.kif >kern.xml

That will make a file full of hex code for your kerning table, that can
be now fused into the font, again with the Font Tools:

ftxdumperfuser --table kern --generic --datafile kern.xml font.ttf

Hex code in the kern data file is nicely formatted and commented, what
can be of much help in case something goes wrong in the process.


THE KIF FILE FORMAT

Kerning Input File, although it once had a mention in Font Tools docs,
hasn't apparently been published by Apple. Here is a reconstruction
of the format based on Morph Input File, a related format still in use.

Parts common to all AAT state machines, i.e., the class listing and the
state table, follow the MIF syntax literally; the rest is modified to
handle the specifics of the kerning table as follows.

Subtable header is shortened to Type and Orientation, both required
fields. These are supplemented with two additional ones, Cross-stream
and Variation, both of a yes/no value that default to 'no':

Type Contextual
Orientation H/V
Cross-stream yes/no
Variation yes/no

Entry table swaps the Mark flag for a Push flag, which pushes current
glyph onto the kern stack. It also has a single action, KernValues, that
gives the name of a list of kern values to apply on the stack:

    GoTo        Push?   Advance?    KernValues
1   StateName   yes/no  yes/no      ListName/none
2   ...

Numeric kern values follow, each list on a separate line with the list's
name in front. Each value is applied to the kern stack in order of
popping the stack glyph by glyph until the list is consumed:

ListName KernValue KernValue ...

This concludes a subtable. Please see the accompanying example directory
for a working example and more commentary.


LIMITATIONS

For now, only contextual kerning subtables are available. Moreover, the
recently found 'kerx' extended kerning table is not fully documented,
so it makes it an old 'kern' table also. Still, the old one works well
in CoreText on both OS X and iOS, so this shouldn't be an issue.
